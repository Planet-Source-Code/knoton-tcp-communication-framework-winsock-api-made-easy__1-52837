## TCP\-Communication Framework Winsock API made easy


</div>

### Description

Updated 2004-04-09: TCP-Communication is my attempt to make a framework to run a TCP-Server without

any protocol. It consists of 2 components TCPServer.dll and TCPClient.dll.

I am a believer to make things that do one thing and that thing very well.

TCP-Communication is an exellent framework to make chatservers for ex.

The components are very easy to use and the developer using them mostly need

to add the appropiate protocol for the TCP-Socket application being made.

I have been working with it on and off for quite som time now, and

from time to time it didn´t respond fast enough for me to approve it.

But then I saw Emiliano Scavuzzo´s CSocketMaster using a implementation of

Paul caton´s WinSubHook. I tried it out and it worked like a charm :-)

However I must say I cannot explain why winsubhook works so much better

than the ordinary subclassing I used.

Anyone care to explain to me ? :-)

The TCP Components are very influenced by some authors and due credit and

a big thanks for teaching me about Socket programming goes to following authors.

Edwin Vermeer

Trevor Herselman

Emiliano Scavuzzo for influencing me to use Paul catons WinsubHook

Other authors on www.planet-Source-code.com/vb

And a big thanks to Paul Caton for providing me with the winsubhook that

are giving me so much better response than the common subclassing techniques.

Only one problem, I cant explain why my TCP-framework respons so much better

with his solution than the common solution. If anyone could try to explain this

to me I would be grateful :-)

Note that the TCP-Components are not needed to be compiled

You could integrate them directly into your project.

For an example look at

http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=52538&lngWId=1

The demo projects are not to be rated, they are a mess and not much energy is used

on developing them. They could be buggy. They are just included to give you an idea

on how to use the TCP-components.

Help me grow as a developer and give me constructive feedback :-)
