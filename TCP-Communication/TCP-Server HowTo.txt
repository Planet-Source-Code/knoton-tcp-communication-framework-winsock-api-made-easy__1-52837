TCP-Server is my attempt to make a framework to run a TCP-Server without any protocol(Chat, Web,IRC...)
The developer who are going to use TCP-Server.dll will have to add the necessary protocol to its TCP-Application.
The component will only handle the communikation between Server <---> Client.
As far as I can tell is the server faster than Winsock.ocx and less cpu and memory demanding.

Testresults on my machine, AMD Duron 750mhz, 768mb memory
3000 connected clients gave 5932k in memory usage on the server.
During the connection of 3000 clients, in a loop, the cpu jumped between 0-40 %

It works excellent for chat-Servers.

HOW IT WORKS:

Note that the parameter sckDesc,sckDescriptor is the socketdescriptor, use this value to keep track of
different clients. for ex in your TCP-Application you could have a Client Collection with the key as
the socketdescriptor.

Public Function StartServing(ByVal lngPort As Long) As Boolean
'The server starts listening for communication on seleced Port, will return true if all went well

Public Sub StopServing()
'The server will stop listening for communikation and will disconnect already connected clients

Public Function NoOfConnections() As Long
'Will return the number of connected client

Public Function SendDataToClient(ByVal sckDesc As Long, ByVal Message As String) As Long
'Transmit data to selected client, returns the number of byte transmitted.

Public Sub SendDataToAll(ByVal Message As String)
'Transmit data to all connected clients

Public Sub CloseSocketHandle(ByVal sckDesc As Long)
'close down the client

Public Function GetUserIP(ByVal sckDesc As Long) As String
'Returns the clients IPnumber

Public Function GetUserHostName(ByVal sckDesc As Long) As String
'Returns the clients HostName

Public Function GetUserPing(ByVal sckDesc As Long, Optional TimeOutMS As Integer = 500) As Integer
'Will ping the client and return the result (Warning the call is not async, go with low TimeoutMS)

EVENTS:

Public Event OnDataArrival(ByVal sckDescriptor As Long, ByVal Data As String)
'Will be triggered when The client sends data

Public Event OnNewConnection(ByVal sckDescriptor As Long)
'Will be triggered when a Client arrives

Public Event OnSocketClose(ByVal sckDescriptor As Long)
'Will be triggered when a client close down, or the server shutdown the client
