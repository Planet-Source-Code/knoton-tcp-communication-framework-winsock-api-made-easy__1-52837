TCP-Client
It was pure coincidence that this component was created. When I was about to try out TCP-Server.dll
could winsock.ocx not test it properly, took too much CPU and memory.
TCP-Client could be used as a framework for ex a Chat-Client

Note:
Instead of indexes I am using socketdescriptor that you could store in an collection for ex...

HOW IT WORKS:

Public Function Connect(ByVal stRemoteHost As String, ByVal RemotePort As Long) As Long
To connect to a server, give this function the serveradress and port.
You will create a new connection for each time you call this function.
Observere that the returnvalue is the socketdescriptor being used, but it is not fully reliable
since the call is async. Trust in Event OnConnection instead.

Public Function Send(ByVal sckDescriptor As Long, ByVal strData As String) As Long
Send data from the client With the given socketdescriptor, to the connected server

Public Sub CloseSocket(ByVal sckDescriptor As Long)
Close the connection with the given socketdescriptor

Public Event OnConnection(ByVal sckDescriptor As Long)
Triggered on a succesful connection.
sckDescriptor is unique for that connection.

Public Event OnDataArrival(ByVal sckDescriptor As Long, Data As String)
Triggered on incoming data to the socket that is connected to the server.

Public Event OnConnectionClose(ByVal sckDescriptor As Long)
Triggered when a socket looses connection on some reason
